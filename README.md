### Pricing both European Options and American Options with the help of solving the following BSDEs ###

The Backward Stochastic Differential Equation (BSDE) is given by:

$$ -dY_t = f(t, Y_t, Z_t)dt  - Z_t^*dW_t; \quad Y_T = \xi , $$

This equation can be solved to find the value of the option at any time $t$ in the interval $[0, T]$:

$$ Y_t = \xi + \int_t^T f(s,Y_s,Z_s)ds + K_T - K_t - \int_t^T Z_sdW_s, \quad \forall t \in [0,T], $$

Using this BSDE, we can price both European and American options by adjusting the equation and solving for the option value $Y_t$.
